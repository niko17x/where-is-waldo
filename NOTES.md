### Rules:
  # User clicks on an area in the photo which enables a 'targeting box' around click.
  # Target box contains a list of possible characters.
  # User selects one of the characters which enables a check with backend server to see if target box contains the character.
  # Provide feedback to user => If correct, place a marker on character else an error message.
  # Remove targeting box after message in both cases.
  # Provide a timer from photo first load to successfully finding last character.
  # After round is completed, get input of player and time to be recorded. Anonymous users can be added.

### Notes:
  # What exactly does `npm run build` do?

### Learned:
  # `npm run build` creates the 'build' directory that will contain index.html and static CSS and JS files. These files contain the minified version of the existing respective source codes. These copies will be optimized for production. Think of it like a final stamp after your development work is completed. If you need to edit a file within the build directory, make changes to the source code then `npm run build`. This will overwrite the existing files within build directory. Not necessary to delete the build directory.
